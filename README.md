# smb3
Disassembly of Super Mario Bros 3 from Southbird, forked for personal hacking use. The extra editor stuff was removed for cleanliness.

Specifically for use with NESASM (https://github.com/camsaul/nesasm), this will reassemble into a byte-for-byte perfect clone of Super Mario Bros. 3 US (PRG1)

-------------

To assemble, simply run:

nesasm smb3.asm

Intended for use for research into the inner workings of SMB3 and highly technical ROM hacks (such as Super Mario Bros. 3Mix)

## Skip Title

Bypasses the intro "cutscene" by acting is player had immediately pressed start when curtain is ready to go up. This does mean the curtain still shows and slightly awkwardly transitions right to the game select menu.
